Read N
Read N  elements of the array
Read X and Y ( X+ Y must be =N)
sort array
p=array[y]-array[y-1]-1
Assume we are dividing the Array into x[] and y[]
all elements in x are greater than some p elements
all ekement  in y are lesser than the same p elements
how many such p eleemnts is possible


we notice that the x elements are in increasing order and y elements small 

so, 
the 1st element in x is array[y]
the 1st element in y array is arrar[0]
the last element in x is array[y-1]

N=11
