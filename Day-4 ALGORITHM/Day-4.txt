We know the number of elements to be sorted ,w hich is n 
hence the outer loop is for looping
we know the number of element in the iunsorted array which is n-i elements , where i is the nu,ber of sorted elements
hence the inner loop too would be for loop 

for i from 0 to n-2 do:
sorted = True #
for j =0 to n-i-2 do :
if array[j]> array[j+1] then:
swap array[j] with array[j+1]
sorted =False

if sorted then:
break
